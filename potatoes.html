        <p>The Rhodes piano is a classic and iconic electric piano that has left an indelible mark on the world of music
            since its introduction in the 1960s. Invented by Harold Rhodes, this electromechanical keyboard instrument
            became synonymous with the warm, lush sounds of jazz, rock, and popular music. The distinctive sound of the
            Rhodes is achieved through a combination of hammers striking metal tines, creating a unique and expressive
            timbre that has been favored by artists ranging from Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder to The Doors and
            Radiohead. The instrument's portability and versatility made it a staple in recording studios, live
            performances, and countless hit records. Despite evolving technology and the advent of digital keyboards,
            the Rhodes piano remains a beloved and sought-after instrument, cherished for its timeless, soulful tones
            that continue to captivate musicians and audiences alike.

        Marathon training is a comprehensive and rigorous preparation process aimed at equipping runners for the
        daunting challenge of completing a 26.2-mile race. This training regimen typically spans several months,
        emphasizing a gradual increase in mileage, cross-training, and targeted workouts to enhance endurance, speed,
        and overall fitness. Runners often follow a structured schedule, incorporating long runs, interval training, and
        recovery days to balance the physical demands and minimize the risk of injury. Nutrition and hydration are
        crucial components of marathon training, ensuring that the body receives the necessary fuel for sustained
        effort. Mental resilience is also fostered during training, as marathon runners must cultivate the determination
        and focus required to conquer the physical and psychological hurdles of the race. The culmination of these
        efforts is not just the physical achievement of completing the marathon but also the personal growth and sense
        of accomplishment that come from the dedication and discipline inherent in the training process.
