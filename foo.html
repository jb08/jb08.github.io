    <h2> RubyConf 2023 </h2>
    <p> RubyConf 2023 ended this evening. I like conferences for exposing me to new topics, such that when I encounter
        them at work, they feel less intimidating. I also like them for <b>networking</b>. I still follow along the work
        of
        people I met at the Denver 2021 conference. This RubyConf<sub>*</sub> was in <i>San Diego</i>. I attended the
        livestream,
        which
        cost $100<sup>1</sup> and provided access to the main stage and Slack community. Here’s a
        summary of
        selected presentations: </p>

    <h3> Keynote by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto </h3>
    <p> Matz, the creator of Ruby, cares deeply about its <strong>continued</strong>
        <em> popularity </em>. He gave BaseCamp,
        Shopify,
        and
        <abbr title="Github">GH</abbr> as
        examples of successful companies built on Ruby. He says Ruby is <q>optimized to start small.</q>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">
        May Ruby remain attractive for future companies. - Matz
    </blockquote>
